Tome SDK Examples
=====================================

This repository contains examples of using the Kotlin implementation
of the Tome SDK to create custom applications for tabletop
role-playing games.


Spell Cards
---------------------------------

The Spell Cards example contains a short script that generates cards
for the spells in a Game. It accepts any generic game definition that
includes spells defined as a values in a value set with the spell
details defined as nested variables in each value. It parses the game
definition, reads the spells, and generates SVG documents for each
spell. The SVG files can then be used in a web page, printed at home,
or sent to a professional printing service. 

You can of course customize the script anyway you would like and give
your players custom spell cards for your own campaign or game.
