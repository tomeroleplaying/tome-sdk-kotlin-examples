                  You create three glowing darts of magical force. Each dart hits a creature of
                  your choice that you can see within range. A dart deals 1d4 + 1 force damage to
                  its target. The darts all strike simultaneously, and you can direct them to hit
                  one creature or several.

                  Eight multicolored rays of light flash from your hand. Each ray is a different
                  color and has a different power and purpose. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must
                  make a Dexterity saving throw. For each target, roll a d8 to determine which
                  color ray affects it.
